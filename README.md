# asiaGeoMapSLDS

the purpose of this repo is to show a very elementary example of how to leverage the GoogleMap API in a Visualforce page to create easy to use maps, which can then be used in Visualforce pages. 

using the Salesforce Lightning Design System (essentially Bootstrap for Visualforce pages), one can still leverage Salesforce Classic but deliver a page with a Lightning UI.
